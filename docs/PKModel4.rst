Example 4 is the first realistic model search example. The search space contains 1.6 million possible models, and searches:
1,2,3 compartments
Between occasion variability
Multiple covaraites (but probably still not as amany as real search)
Different absorption models
Different resisual error models
Block OMEGA structures
Different initial estimates (also likely not as many as a real search).
