Example 6: PK Model, DMAG by GA with post-run Python code
==============================================
  

.. _startpk5:

Example 4 is the first realistic model search example. The search space contains 1.6 million possible models, and searches:

1,2,3 compartments

Between occasion variability

Multiple covaraites (but probably still not as amany as real search)

Different absorption models

Different residual error models

Block OMEGA structures

Different initial estimates (also likely not as many as a real search).
