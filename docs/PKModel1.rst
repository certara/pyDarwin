PK Model 1, trivial exhaustive search
==============================================
This first model is quite simple, the search space consistes of 6 dimensions, each with 2 options. Thus, the total number of candiate models is 
2^6 = 64 models. As the search space if very small, we'll search by exhaustive search.
